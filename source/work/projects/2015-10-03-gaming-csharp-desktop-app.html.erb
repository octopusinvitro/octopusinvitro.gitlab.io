<p>This is one of my C&#35; desktop applications. It's a Noughts and Crosses game that can be played against another person or against an unbeatable robot. The robot can use several algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>MiniMax</li>
<li>NegaMax</li>
<li>MiniMax with alpha-beta pruning</li>
<li>NegaMax with alpha-beta pruning</li>
<li>I also started implementing the MTD-f algorithm in a branch, but it's a work in progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose who plays first, and the size of the board (3x3 or 4x4).</p>
<p>It also has a dedicated site that you can visit at:<br />

<p>You can check out the code here:<br />
