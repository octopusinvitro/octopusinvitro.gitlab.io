<p>I participated in my first <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39">Ludum Dare</a> ever. It's a game jam where you have to make a videogame in a weekend. You have to do everything: the code, the art, the music, etc.</p>

<p>The theme for LD-39 was <strong>Running out of Power</strong>, so after a bit of brainstorming I decided to make a walking eye whose battery is constantly discharging, and you have to solve a circuit so that the eye can charge. It's called "BatteRun".</p>

<p>I thought I would give it a try and make an HTML5 game using <a href="https://phaserjs.com/">the Phaser library</a>. Web games are easy to code and share, and anyone can play them without installing anything.</p>

<p>However I miscalculated how long it would take me to use a library for the first time while also doing a weekend challenge like this, so I ran out of time before I finished it. As a result, the game only has one level that repeats in a loop, forever ðŸ˜†. I would like to come back to this project and finish it though!</p>
