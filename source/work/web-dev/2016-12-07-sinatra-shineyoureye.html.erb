While working at <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>, I helped build and define what will become the new Pombola Lite approach to building parliamentary monitoring sites. Some of my tasks included creating and separating the core-backend code from the custom-site-specific code in a Sinatra application, so that it can be used with other countries in the future and not just with Shine your Eye.</p>

<p>It has the same approach as the <a href="/work/web-dev/sinatra-everypolitician">viewer-sinatra project</a>, i.e., the site generated by Sinatra is then scraped to generate a static site served by GitHub pages. I wrote about the technical details of this process in <a href="/blog/web-development/porting-a-site-from-django-to-static">this blog post</a>.</p>
