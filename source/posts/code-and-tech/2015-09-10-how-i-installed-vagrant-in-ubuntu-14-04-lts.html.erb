<p>You will need to install two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vagrant</li>
<li>A virtual machine</li>
</ul>
<p>To install Vagrant, the best way is to go to their dedicated page:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/">https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation</a></p>
<p>There are several ways you can do this:</p>
<h2>Installing Vagrant from package managers</h2>
<p>In many blog posts around the web, you will find people recommending this way of installing, using <code class="language-bash">apt-get install vagrant</code>. This is <strong>not</strong> the recommended way, as stated in the official site:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Beware of system package managers! Some operating system distributions include a vagrant package in their upstream package repos. Please do not install Vagrant in this manner. Typically these packages are missing dependencies or include very outdated versions of Vagrant. If you install via your system's package manager, it is very likely that you will experience issues. Please use the official installers on the downloads page."</p></blockquote>
<h2>Installing Vagrant from Source</h2>
<p>Installing Vagrant from source is an advanced topic and is only recommended when using the official installer is not an option. This page details the steps and prerequisites for installing Vagrant from source.</p>
<p>But if you still want to install from source, here is the link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/source.html">https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/source.html</a></p>
<h2>Installing Vagrant from the official installers</h2>
<p>Here is a list of the official installers for four different O.S. For ubuntu 14.04, download the Debian package. I have a 64bit machine, so I downloaded that package:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html</a></p>
<p>This will download a <code>.deb</code> file, that you can double click and it will be opened in Ubuntu Software Center, where you just have to click the "Install" button. Or you can install it through the terminal. Go to the folder where you installed it and type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ sudo dpkg -i vagrant_1.8.4_x86_64
</code></pre>
<h2>After installing</h2>
<p>Check that you have installed Vagrant correctly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ vagrant --version
Vagrant 1.8.4
</code></pre>
<p>The installer will create a directory for the Vagrant installation to live in <code>/opt/vagrant</code> directory, and will link to an executable in the <code>/usr/bin/vagrant</code>.</p>
<p>This way, when you uninstall Vagrant, you can do so very cleanly by doing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
rm -rf /opt/vagrant
rm -f /usr/bin/vagrant
</code></pre>
<p>The installer will also create a <code>~/.vagrant.d</code> in your home directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ tree .vagrant.d/
.vagrant.d/
├── boxes
├── data
│   ├── machine-index
│   │   └── index.lock
│   └── checkpoint_signature
├── gems
│   └── ruby
│       └── 2.2.0
├── rgloader
│   └── loader.rb
├── tmp
├── insecure_private_key
└── setup_version

8 directories, 5 files
</code></pre>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vagrant-Up-Running-Mitchell-Hashimoto/dp/1449335837">official book</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Vagrant puts all global state by default into the ~/.vagrant.d folder, including boxes. This means that when Vagrant manages boxes “globally,” it actually means it manages boxes per user, by default. Because boxes can be large (sometimes gigabytes), you can move this global state directory by setting the environmental variable VAGRANT_HOME to another directory."</p></blockquote>
<p>To do so, in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file, add:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
# vagrant
export VAGRANT_HOME="$DATA/vagrant"
</code></pre>
<p>now run your bash file for the changes to take effect</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ . ~/.bashrc</code>
</pre>
<h2>You will need a Virtual Machine to run it</h2>
<p>Make a directory somewhere and cd into it. Type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ vagrant init hashicorp/precise64
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a <code>Vagrantfile</code> which contains Ruby code, basically configuration stuff for Vagrant. The Vagrantfile is a simple text file that Vagrant reads in order to determine what needs to be done to create your working environment. This file is meant to be placed under version control.</p>
<p>Now if you do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ vagrant up
No usable default provider could be found for your system.
</code></pre>
<p>You get an error because you don't have any VM installed.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads">Linux downloads</a> page in VirtualBox's official site, and download the deb file for Ubuntu 14.04, in my case AMD64 because I have Intel 65 bits. Again you can double-click it and install it from the USC. You will have all these programs available from the terminal: VBox, VBoxAutostart, VBoxBalloonCtrl, VBoxDTrace, VBoxHeadless, VBoxManage, VBoxSDL, VBoxTunctl, VBoxVRDP, VirtualBox, rdesktop-vrdp, vbox-img, vboxautostart, vboxballoonctrl, vboxheadless, vboxmanage, vboxsdl, vboxwebsrv, virtualbox.</p>
<p>You can head of to the VirtualBox manuals:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.24/UserManual.pdf">User manual pdf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html">User manual html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Check that you have installed it properly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ virtualbox
</code></pre>
<p>This should open the VirtualBox GUI.</p>
<p>Now go ahead and repeat the previous command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ vagrant up

</code></pre>
<p>If you open virtual box now, you will see Vagrant is loaded.</p>

<p>You can log in to the VM using:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
vagrant ssh log in
</code></pre>

<p>And you can destroy the VM using:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">
vagrant destroy terminate the VM
</code></pre>
