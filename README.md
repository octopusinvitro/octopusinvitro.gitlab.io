## GitLab CI

This project's static Pages are built by [GitLab CI][ci], following the steps
defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml):

```
image: ruby:2.1

cache:
  paths:
  - vendor

test:
  script:
  - apt-get update -yqqq
  - apt-get install -y nodejs
  - bundle install --path vendor
  - bundle exec middleman build
  except:
    - master

pages:
  script:
  - apt-get update -yqqq
  - apt-get install -y nodejs
  - bundle install --path vendor
  - bundle exec middleman build
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  only:
  - master
```

## GitLab User or Group Pages

To use this project as your user/group website, you will need one additional
step: just rename your project to `namespace.gitlab.io`, where `namespace` is
your `username` or `groupname`. This can be done by navigating to your
project's **Settings**.

Read more about [user/group Pages][userpages] and [project Pages][projpages].

## Did you fork this project?

If you forked this project for your own use, please go to your project's
**Settings** and remove the forking relationship, which won't be necessary
unless you want to contribute back to the upstream project.

## Troubleshooting

1. CSS is missing! That means two things:

    Either that you have wrongly set up the CSS URL in your templates, or
    your static generator has a configuration option that needs to be explicitly
    set in order to serve static assets under a relative URL.
